Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Peter and I am a student at Western College. I am writing to you today because I am interested in joining your sports club.
I have recently started a course and I am looking for a way to stay active and healthy. I am particularly interested in [Specific Sports or Activities] and I believe that your club would be a great fit for me.
I would like to ask you a few questions about the club. What facilities are available? How many members are there? What are the costs? What are the hours of operation? What are the policies on cancellations and refunds?
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully,
Peter

Dear Mary,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you today to invite you to Ho Chi Minh City for a short visit.
I know you are coming to Hanoi for an international conference, but I thought it would be a shame if you didn't have the chance to see Ho Chi Minh City as well. It is a beautiful and vibrant city with a lot to offer visitors.
I would be happy to show you around Ho Chi Minh City and introduce you to some of my favorite places. I know you will love it here! Please let me know if you are interested in coming to Ho Chi Minh City. I can book a hotel room for you and help you plan your itinerary.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
All the best,
Peter

Dear Susan,

I'm so excited to hear that you're planning a trip to Vietnam! It's a beautiful country with a lot to offer visitors.
The weather in Vietnam in May is hot and humid. The average temperature is around 30 degrees Celsius. You should pack light clothes that are made of breathable materials. You may also want to pack a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun.
Here are some places you should visit in Vietnam: 
Ho Chi Minh City: This is the largest city in Vietnam and is a great place to start your trip. There are many historical and cultural attractions in Ho Chi Minh City, such as the Notre Dame Cathedral and the War Remnants Museum. 
Hoi An: This is a beautiful town that is known for its well-preserved architecture. Hoi An is a great place to wander around and explore the narrow streets.
Here are some of the best Vietnamese food to try: 
Pho: This is a noodle soup that is a popular breakfast dish.
Banh mi: This is a baguette sandwich that is filled with meat, vegetables, and pickled vegetables.
Here are some souvenirs you can buy for your parents and your youngest sister:
	Silk scarves: These are a popular souvenir from Vietnam.

I hope this helps! I'm sure you'll have a great time in Vietnam.
Best,
Peter
